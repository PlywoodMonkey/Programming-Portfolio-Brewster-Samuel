@ Main Function -Initializes Variabes and Calls Deblock.
main:
	mov r5, #0
	mov r6, #0
	mov r7, #0
    b _deblock

@ Deblock Function - Calls Deblock from Class Library.
_deblock:  
    mov r0, #1				@ when r0 = 1, calling deblock enables it
    bl  E4235_KYBdeblock	@ call Class Library Deblock
    b _start				@ Begin Program

@ Read Function - Read Input from STDIN and Store in a variable in =input.
_read:
	mov r0, #0				@ file descriptor for stdin
	mov r2, #1				@ allocates bytes to read
	mov r7, #3				@ svc read
	ldr r1, =input			@ load the address of the =input variable
	str r0, [r1]			@ reset input
	svc 0
	ldrb r1, [r1]			@ read byte in input
	bx lr
  
@ Check Function - Checks if the user input is valid and branches accordingly.  
_check:
	cmp r1, #'R'    		@ Run
	beq _run
	cmp r1, #'L'    		@ Lap
	beq _lap

    beq _stop
    cmp r1, #'C'    		@ Clear
    beq _clear

@ Run Function - Sets the program to run and stop lapping.
_run:
	mov r5, #1				@ Set Run Flag = 1
	mov r6, #0				@ Set Lap Flag = 1
	bx lr					@ Return to tracking time
      
@ Lap Function - Makes the Program Start Lapping, aka, stop printing.
_lap:
	mov r6, #1				@ Set Lap Flag = 1
	bx   lr					@ Return to tracking time
  
@ Stop Function - Stops the Program from tracking time, basically just stops the run function.  
_stop:
	mov r5, #0				@ Set Run Flag = 0
	mov r7, #1
	bx lr					@ Return to tracking time
	
_stop_print:
	mov r7, #0
	b print
	
@ Clear Function - Stops the Program with the Run Flag and Sets Variables to 0.

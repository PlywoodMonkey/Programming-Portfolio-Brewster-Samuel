The following program was written in ARM Assembly and provides the function of a stopwatch. It has four commands: "Run" (R), "Lap" (L), "Stop" (S), and "Clear" (C). 

"Run" - Starts the stopwatch.
"Lap" - Stops the program from printing the current time, but continues on counting. If the user inputs 'L' again, then the program continues from where the count is currently at and starts printing again.
"Stop" - Stops the stopwatch.
"Clear" - Stops the stopwatch and sets it to 00:00:00.

The program is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and it requires no hardware.

This project is a handheld device that allows the user to see their real 8 Digit Grid position and checks their body temperature, both of which are displayed on a LED screen. The project uses a SAM M10Q GPS Sensor to gather the user's location and then uses a function to convert the coordinate into a readable 8 digit Grid. It also uses a linearized thermistor to check the userâ€™s body temperature.

*NOTE* - The conversion function was found online and may be freely used. It was NOT written by me, but utilized for ease of use and is fairly cited in the comments of the file.

The following files provide a user the ability to encode a file into morse code by using a morse code tapper and to decode a file that is written in morse code. The length of what constitutes a dot or dash is prompted to the user at the start of the program.

The morse code encoder reads from the user's inputs on a morse code 'tapper' and is saved to a file location that can be specified by the user. As the tapper is pushed, an LED lights up and a speaker sounds to alert the user of the dots/dashes used in the message.

The morse code decoder reads from a file provided bythe user and outputs the contents of the file via an LED and speaker. It also decodes the contents into english and saves them into a file.
